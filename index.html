Research
===============================================================================
- *Lambda-KV: Distributed Key-Value store with colocated Serverless compute*
    <br>[Paper](lKV.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/SimpleDB)
    <br>Advisors: [Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/) and [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/)

    - Serverless execution framework aggregates compute and storage resources into a single entity that aggressively exploits data locality to significantly improve efficiency.
    - Lambda-KV improves the overall execution time of serverless compilation workloads by a factor of 1.6x and 5x reduction in time spent in data movement against conventional disaggregated deployments.

    <br>[Paper](sRoCE.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/mani-shailesh/rdma-tas)
    <br>Advisors: [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/) and [Prof. Chris Rossbach](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/)

    - Software-based flexible RDMA verbs implementation using high performance user-space TCP stack.
    - Achieved 3x single-connection throughput for 1000 bytes RDMA ops as compared to H/W RDMA NICs.

- *Improving Connection Scalability in [TAS: TCP Acceleration as an OS Service](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/documents/19eurosys_tas.pdf)*
    <br>[Paper](tas_scale.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/tas)
    <br>Advisor: [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/)

    - Increased throughput by 10&percnt; at 100k connections by improving the performance of flow pacing algorithm.
    - Overhead of Queue Manager – Fair Queueing (FP) based flow scheduler in TAS increases with the number of connections. In place of it, we use [Carousel](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~amsmti3/files/carousel-sigcomm17.pdf) to achieve ~1.2x times higher throughput and decrease in CPU utilization of enqueue operation by 50% in comparison with FQ pacing for greater than 16k connections.

- *A Reinforcement Learning Framework for QoS-Driven Radio Resource Scheduler*
    - *Abstract*: In cellular communication systems, radio resources are allocated to users by the MAC scheduler, that typically runs at the base station (BS). The task of the scheduler is to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements of each data flow while maximizing the system throughput and achieving a desired level of fairness amongst users. Traditional schedulers use handcrafted metrics and are meticulously tuned to achieve a delicate balance between multiple, often conflicting objectives. Diverse QoS requirements of 5G networks further complicate traditional schedulers. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based scheduler that learns an allocation policy to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. Our approach allows network operators to customize their requirements, by assigning priority values to QoS classes. In addition, we adopt a flexible neural-network architecture that can easily adapt to varying number of flows, drastically simplifying training, thus rendering it viable for practical implementation in constrained systems. We demonstrate, via simulations, that our algorithm outperforms conventional heuristics such as M-LWDF, EXP-RULE and LOGRULE and is robust to changes in radio environment and traffic patterns.
