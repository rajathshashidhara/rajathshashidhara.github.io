![ ](rajath.jpg width="28%" border="2") I am a graduate student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/) at The University of Texas at Austin.
Previously, I was a member of the 5G Communication R&D Team at Samsung Research, Bangalore. I have a keen interest in research and development of scalable, efficient and resilient computing systems.
Presently, I am working on building high-performance TCP stacks accelerated by SmartNICs advised by Prof. [Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/). You can find my resume [here](cv.pdf).

Research
===============================================================================
- Lambda-KV: Distributed Key-Value store with colocated Serverless compute
    <br>[Paper](lKV.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/SimpleDB)
    <br>Advisors: [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/) and [Prof. Vijay Chidambaram](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay/)

    - Serverless execution framework aggregates compute and storage resources into a single entity that aggressively exploits data locality to significantly improve efficiency.
    - Lambda-KV improves the overall execution time of serverless compilation workloads by a factor of 1.6x and 5x reduction in time spent in data movement against conventional disaggregated deployments.

- SRoCE: Software RDMA over Commodity Ethernet
    <br>[Paper](sRoCE.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/mani-shailesh/rdma-tas)
    <br>Advisors: [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/) and [Prof. Chris Rossbach](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/)

    - Software-based flexible RDMA verbs implementation using high performance user-space TCP stack.
    - Achieved 3x single-connection throughput for 1000 bytes RDMA ops as compared to H/W RDMA NICs.

- Improving Connection Scalability in [TAS: TCP Acceleration as an OS Service](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/documents/19eurosys_tas.pdf)
    <br>[Paper](tas_scale.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/tas)
    <br>Advisor: [Prof. Simon Peter](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~simon/)

    - Increased throughput by 10&percnt; at 100k connections by improving the performance of flow pacing algorithm.
    - Overhead of Queue Manager – Fair Queueing (FP) based flow scheduler in TAS increases with the number of connections. In place of it, we use [Carousel](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~amsmti3/files/carousel-sigcomm17.pdf) to achieve ~1.2x times higher throughput and decrease in CPU utilization of enqueue operation by 50% in comparison with FQ pacing for greater than 16k connections.

- A Reinforcement Learning Framework for QoS-Driven Radio Resource Scheduler
    - 5G MAC scheduler that learns an allocation policy to simultaneously optimize multiple, often conflicting QoS objectives.
    - Approach allows network operators to customize their requirements, by assigning priority values to QoS classes.
    - Presents a flexible neural-network architecture that can easily adapt to varying number of flows, drastically simplifying training, thus rendering it viable for practical implementation in constrained systems.
    - Outperforms conventional heuristics such as M-LWDF, EXP-RULE and LOGRULE and is robust to changes in radio environment and traffic patterns.

- Studying Quantum Chaos in Aubry-Andr&#xE9; electron systems
    <br>[Paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.053612) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/DiscreteSchrodinger) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Thesis](thesis.pdf)
    <br>Advisor: [Dr. Tapomoy Guha Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FLFD3-gAAAAJ&hl=en)

    - Studied phase transitions in Hofstadter’s butterfly under time-varying magnetic field and the relationship between topological invariants and Hall conductivity.
    - Simulated and computationally evaluated solutions to Schrodinger’s equation for special quantum systems using perturbation methods and computational physics algorithms.

- Distributed Combinatorial Optimization on a Cluster
    <br>[Report](design_bnb.pdf) &thinsp; &#8226; &ensp; [Code](https://github.com/rajathshashidhara/Distributed-Branch-and-Bound)
    <br>Advisor: [Prof. Sundar Balasubramaniam](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sundar_Balasubramaniam)

    - Designed a distributed algorithm to efficiently perform Branch & Bound search on a commodity cluster.
    - Developed  a  load  balancing  technique  based  on peer-to-peer   diffusion between  nodes  on  toroid communication topology and leftist-heap based work-stealing queues between threads.
